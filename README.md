# Fallout Password Checker

A little script to help you quickly work out what passwords work when hacking terminals in Fallout 3 and Fallout: New Vegas. Maybe it works in Fallout 4 too? I've not played it.

Instructions
------------

You must have ruby and git installed and be vaguely comfortable with the command line.

1. Open terminal

2. Clone the project:

  `git clone https://github.com/burythehammer/fallout-password-checker.git`

3. Navigate to folder you cloned it into (command is for OSX/Linux, you're on your own for Windows)

  `cd fallout-password-checker`

4. Execute password.rb:

    `ruby password.rb`

5. Follow the instructions. Enter the first password and how many it got correct, and then start trying out others against it.

6. Once you get it right, hit ctrl-c to quit.
